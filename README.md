# Effect of Many Modes on Self-Polarization and Photochemical Suppression in Cavities - Supplementaries

Supplementary movies to [THIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07330) paper.



We provide three movies:


1.MovieSingleMode.mp4 shows the nuclear dynamics for the cavity free case (pink) and for a coupling to one resonant photon mode with coupling strength λ= 0.005 and resonant frequency 0.1 for the full quantum solution (black), quantum nuclei with MTE treatment for the photons (blue) and MTE treatment for nuclei and photos (light blue) in comparison. The surfaces represent the BO surfaces (pink) and spBO surfaces (black)with the coupling to the one resonant photon mode. This movie corresponds to the results given in Fig.2 in the paper.


2.MovieMultiModeWithSP.mp4shows the spBO surfaces (upper panel), the nuclear density (second panel),the R-resolved BO-population (third and last panel) over time. Here we treat the photons with the MTE-approach, the matter part quantum mechanically and all simulations include the self-polarization term. As in (1.) we choose the coupling strength to be λ=0.005 for all cases and compare the dynamics of the cavity free case (pink), the coupling to a single resonant mode (black) and the coupling to 10- (green), 40- (orange), 200-(red), 440- (blue) photon modes. This movie corresponds to Fig.3 and Fig.4 in the paper.


3.MovieMultiMode.mp4 shows the same calculations, dynamics and comparison as (2.), however now without taking the self-polarization into account and the upper panel now shows the BO-surfaces. This movie gives more details for the discussion of Fig.6.
